            <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
            <p>
                Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It is used as an indicator of
                overall health and can help identify potential weight-related health risks.

            <h2>How is BMI calculated?</h2>
            <p>
                BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kilograms) by the square of their height (in
                meters). The formula is as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
            </p>
