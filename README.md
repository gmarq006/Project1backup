# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è exercisewise: BMI Calculator & Recipe Advisor  üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Paragraph 1: What was the assignment or task?
The task for this group project was to create a BMI calculator with an API for BMI information and health recipes. The BMI calculator should take the user's inputs for height and weight and provide them with their Body Mass Index (BMI). Additionally, the calculator should make API requests to retrieve information about the BMI category and health recipes based on the calculated BMI.
## Paragraph 2: What was our motivation?
Our motivation behind building this project was to develop a user-friendly BMI calculator that goes beyond providing just the BMI value. We wanted to enhance the user experience by offering relevant exercise information, such as the BMI category (underweight, average weight, overweight, or obese), and providing exercise  planners tailored to the user's BMI to promote a exercise lifestyle. By combining these features into a single tool, we aimed to make it easier for users to understand their exercise status and access suitable planners to improve their well-being.
## Paragraph 3: What problem does it solve?
Our BMI calculator with API integration aims to address two primary problems:
It provides users a straightforward and convenient way to calculate their BMI by inputting their height and weight.
It offers more than just the BMI value by fetching information about the user's BMI category, which helps them understand whether they are in a healthy weight range or need to make lifestyle changes.
The calculator retrieves exercise planners tailored to the user's BMI category, which empowers users to make exercise dietary choices and improve their overall exercise and well-being.
## Paragraph 4: What did we learn? Why did we build this project?
Through building this project, we learned several valuable lessons. Firstly, we enhanced our skills in frontend web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface. We also gained experience working with APIs and making asynchronous API requests to fetch data from the server.
The project allowed us to apply our knowledge of BMI calculations, exercise information retrieval, and API integration in a real-world scenario. Additionally, we improved our collaboration and communication skills as we worked together as a team to divide tasks, share ideas, and ensure the successful completion of the project.
Overall, we built this project to create a helpful tool that promotes exercise awareness and encourages exercise lifestyle choices for users. We believe our project can positively impact users' lives and contribute to a exercise society by offering a comprehensive BMI calculator with additional exercise-related information and planners.
